lpq_martix_homework
===================

This is my homework for **martix class** somewhere.


Dear Mr. LÃ¼, 

As you can see, I wrote this several months ago, at which time I was reading sth relating to Local Binary Pattern and LPQ.
I didn't do much research about that :( And now i got no enough time to re-test that.

Now i'm dealing with FDA(LDA) for classification. 
You can view part of my works at

It is not finished yet cause i've got no time(lazy?) to pull them there.
